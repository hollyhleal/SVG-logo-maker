# SVG Logo Maker

In this project, I created a command-line application to develop a simple SVG logo. I completed the following:

1. When the command-line application launches, the user is presented with a series of prompts, beginning with the prompt to enter up to three characters.
2. Next, the user is prompted to enter a text color, where they can respond with a color keyword OR a hexidecimal number.
3. Next, the user is prompted to choose from a list of shapes: circle, triangle or square.
4. Next, the user is prompted for the shape's color, where they can respond with a color keyword OR a hexidecimal number.
5. After the prompts have concluded, an SVG file is created named `logo.svg` under the `examples` directory.
6. Additionally, the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line.
7. When the `logo.svg` file is opened, it displays as a 300x200 pixel image that matches the user-entered criteria.
